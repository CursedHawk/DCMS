# Policy for the media-worker service.
#
# Read-only, and scoped to exactly two paths: the shared configuration every service needs
# and this service's own. That scoping is the point of having a policy per service at all --
# the previous deployment gave every service one token with read on secret/data/dcms/*, so a
# compromise of any single container exposed every secret the platform holds, including the
# SMTP relay password and the Forgejo admin token.
#
# Generated shape; extras (Transit) are added explicitly below where a service needs them.
